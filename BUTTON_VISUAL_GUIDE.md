# 🎨 Quick Visual Guide - Updated Done Buttons

## Before & After

### BEFORE (Confusing) ❌
```
Pending task:  [✓ Done] - Green button (confusing!)
Completed task: [↶ Undo] - Gray button (unclear)
```

### AFTER (Clear!) ✅
```
Pending task:  [ Mark as Done ] - 🟡 Yellow button (action needed!)
Completed task: [ ✓ Completed ] - 🟢 Green button (done!)
                ~~Strikethrough text~~
```

## 🎯 Visual Color Coding

### 🟡 Yellow = "You Need to Do This"
- Button says: **"Mark as Done"**
- Meaning: This task is **pending** and waiting for you
- Action: Click to mark it complete

### 🟢 Green = "This is Finished"
- Button says: **"✓ Completed"**
- Meaning: This task is **done**
- Task text: ~~Strikethrough with 70% opacity~~
- Action: Click to undo if needed
