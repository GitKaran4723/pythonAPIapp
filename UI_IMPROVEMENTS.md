## 🐛 Bugs Fixed

### Issue 1: "All tasks showing as done"
**Problem**: Tasks were incorrectly showing completed status
**Fix**: Updated `_merge_completion_status()` to only mark tasks as done if they exist in `task_completions` table with `completed=1`

### Issue 2: "Some tasks not reverting"
**Problem**: When clicking completed button, some tasks stayed completed
**Fix**: 
- Ensured `DELETE FROM task_completions` properly removes records
- Added logic to reset status to "Pending" if not in completions table
- Improved status detection to handle edge cases

### Issue 3: "Button colors unclear"
**Problem**: Green "Done" button confused users (is it done or should I click it?)
**Fix**:
- Pending: Yellow "Mark as Done" (clear call to action)
- Completed: Green "✓ Completed" (clear status indicator)
